# Twimba - Social Media Platform

## Description
"Twimba" is a simplified social media platform inspired by Twitter (referred to as "X" now), created as part of a guided project with additional features implemented independently. It allows users to interact with tweets through likes, retweets, and comments. Beyond the Scrimba curriculum, I introduced a login and signup functionality, utilizing localStorage to save user accounts for persistent access.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Incorporated `textarea` for user input in tweet composition.
- Utilized `Array.forEach()` to iterate over tweet elements.
- Managed user interactions with `data` attributes.
- Applied conditional rendering of styles to reflect tweet states.
- Implemented the logical NOT operator (`!`) to toggle like and retweet states.
- Leveraged CDNs to import necessary libraries and icons.
- Extended functionality to include UUID generation for unique identification.
- Developed login and signup pages to simulate user authentication and session management.

## Personal Enhancement
- Designed a user authentication system to manage user sessions.
- Persisted user credentials and session states using localStorage.
